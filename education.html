								<h1>Publication (Senior Project)</h1>
								<h2>Heat Treatment Control of Residual Stress and Microstructure of 3D-Printed 316L Stainless Steel</h2>
								<p>
									• Developed heat treatment experiments to test and measure residual stress in 316L stainless steel tensile test bars produced by selective laser melting<br>
									• Utilized x-ray diffraction (XRD) to measure residual stress<br>
									• Analyzed residual stress data using Matlab<br>
									• Designed an XRD fixture using Solidworks for sample alignment in the XRD machine • Utilized SEM and optical microscopy for microstructural examination<br>
									• Compared hardness and tensile test data to determine changes in mechanical properties tied to microstructural changes<br>
									• Used standard metallographic techniques to prepare samples for testing and examination
